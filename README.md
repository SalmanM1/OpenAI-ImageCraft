# OpenAI ImageCraft

OpenAI ImageCraft is a website that harnesses OpenAI's Dall-E models to create images from textual descriptions. It's built using Node.js, Express, and connects seamlessly with OpenAI's API.

## How It Works

OpenAI ImageCraft operates through the following process:

- **User Input**: Users enter a textual description of the image they want to create.
- **OpenAI Integration**: The application utilizes OpenAI's Dall-E models to interpret the text and generate a corresponding image.
- **Image Display**: The generated image is displayed to the user, providing a visual representation of their text.

## Instructions for Use

- **Obtain an API Key**: Register at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) and add the API key to the `.env` file.
- **Download the Files**: Download the files in the repository and run in a developer environment.
